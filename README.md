)

Check availability of a website
useful to tell if gh-pages are enabled by running curl

Usage is straightforward check sample file:

[.github/workflows/url.yaml](.github/workflows/url.yaml)

if url parameter is omitted,
then by default action will check
if project has a github page online.

An other more advanced reciepe to attempt to deploy to gh-pages:

[.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml](.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml)


For the record i made it to prevent deploying to gh-pages,
when forking projects that have this feature enabled.

Typical observed issue when using actions/deploy-pages@v4

```
