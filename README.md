Check availability of a website
useful to tell if gh-pages are enabled by running curl


## URL AVAILABILITY

Usage is straightforward check sample file:

[.github/workflows/url.yaml](.github/workflows/url.yaml)

It just probe availability of URL using curl command.

if url parameter is omitted,
then by default action will check
if project has a github page online.


## GITHUB PAGES AVAILABILITY

An other more advanced recipe that attempt to deploy to gh-pages,

[.github/workflows/gh-pages.yaml](.github/workflows/gh-pages.yaml)

If URL of github-page is not available,
it is assumed that gh-pages is not enabled
then it will just bypass
and make the workflow successful.

For the record i made it to prevent deploying to gh-pages,
when forking projects that have this feature enabled.

Typical observed issue when using actions/deploy-pages@v4

```
Fetching artifact metadata for "github-pages" in this workflow run
